# Password Generator 

## Description
In this challenge we were given starter code for a password generator. We had to ensure that we allowed the user to generate a random password based on their input after answering a few questions. 

## Installation

## Usage 
Here is the link to the deployed website:
 https://cristian01021.github.io/Mod3hw1/



 After clicking the the link I provided the page will look like this:

This is start the few questions that it prompts the user to answer, starting with the number of characters the user desires.
